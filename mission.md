## My Mission

To democratize data science by stripping away the jargon and complexity. I believe that **complex data analysis should not be a black box**.

My goal is not just to deliver a report, but to leave your team with:
1.  **Understanding** of the methods used.
2.  **Confidence** to interpret the results.
3.  **Skills** to maintain the solution moving forward.
