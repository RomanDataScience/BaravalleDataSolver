## Bridging the Gap Between Complex Science and Actionable Data

I am Roman Baravalle, a **Computational Neuroscientist** and **Data Solver** dedicated to making complex data approachable. With a **Ph.D. in Physics** and years of experience within U.S. research institutions modeling biological systems, I specialize in turning massive, messy datasets into clear, interpretable results.

### My Academic Foundation
My journey in data began with my Ph.D. thesis, where I focused on **studying correlations in massive databases of electrophysiological signals**. By applying **advanced statistics and Information Theory**, I worked to decode the intricacies of information transmission within the brain. 

This background in high-stakes, high-complexity academic research taught me that the most powerful data solutions are those built on a foundation of mathematical rigor and absolute clarity.

### My "Data Solver" Philosophy
I believe that good data science isn’t just about the complexity of the tools—it’s about the quality of the understanding. My work is built on three pillars:

* **Clarity:** Translating advanced computational methods into accessible insights.
* **Reproducibility:** Developing transparent, well-documented code that your team can trust.
* **Empowerment:** Building intuitive workflows that allow teams to own their data journey from raw input to discovery.

### Technical Expertise
Beyond the brain, I help research teams and organizations with:
* **Data Management:** Cleaning and organizing raw datasets for long-term scalability.
* **Advanced Modeling:** Applying physics-based logic and statistical theory to biological and business systems.
* **Workflow Automation:** Building robust, extendable pipelines in Python and R.
