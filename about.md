        Hi, I’m <strong>Roman Baravalle</strong>, a computational neuroscientist passionate about making complex data approachable and actionable. With a <strong>PhD in Physics</strong> and years of experience in U.S. research institutions modeling brain and biological systems, I help research teams turn massive, messy datasets into clear, interpretable results.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My work focuses on practical data solutions: cleaning and organizing raw data, developing transparent and well-documented code, and building intuitive analyses that teams can understand, trust, and extend. I believe that good data science isn’t just about powerful tools—it’s about <strong>clarity, reproducibility, and shared understanding</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through clear data visualizations and hands-on guidance, I help teams build confidence in their computational workflows. My goal is simple: to empower clients to not only generate insights but to <strong>own their data journey</strong>, from raw input to meaningful discovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        My expertise is built on the rigorous study of correlations in massive databases of electrophysiological signals. By applying <strong>Information Theory and Advanced Statistics</strong>, I’ve spent my career decoding how information is transmitted through complex systems. Today, I translate those same scientific principles into reliable workflows for my clients.
